1.I create javafx project so that i could hava interface.
By creating Device class i extend it for subclasses(Smartphone, Laptop and Tablet)
so that they will be able to inherite some attributes and methods of Device class,
and type so that each of them could have their own properties.
2.Then i create methods in fxml to implement my interface in scene builder
3.I create Vbox and Tabpane so that i could hav—É tabs for each devices, added
labels and textfields.
4.How do my project work? First of all i need to initialize the code, after
that will occure the interface on which i will need to choose devices where
will be information like name, weight, screenSize and so on.
